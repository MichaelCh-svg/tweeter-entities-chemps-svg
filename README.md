# Steps for setting up project.

### Make the following changes to package.json:

Change the name of the module in package.json next to the "name" parameter. Make sure it is not the same name as an already existing public npm module.

Change the version to be "0.0.1".

### Install dependencies, login to npm, and publish the results
Run 'npm i' in the terminal to install the dependencies specified in the package.json file.

Run 'npm publish' in the terminal.
-If you have not logged in to npm yet, look at [setup from scratch](SETUP_FROM_SCRATCH.md) to see how.

### Publishing a new version
Change the version in the package.json file.
Run npm publish.
